# Student-placement-management-system

A full-stack web application that provides a portal for managing student job placements. This project demonstrates a practical, real-world use case for a Java-powered backend serving a dynamic, single-page web application.

The application handles full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for students and companies, managed through a professional and visually stunning "glassmorphism" user interface.


### **Features**

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - **Create:** Add new students and companies to the system.
  - **Read:** Fetch and display dynamically updated lists of all students and companies.
  - **Update:** Assign a student to a company, which updates the student's status.
- **RESTful API:** A well-defined Java backend API to handle all data manipulations.
- **Modern UI/UX:** A professional, dark-themed frontend featuring:
  - **Glassmorphism:** A frosted-glass effect on UI panels.
  - **Animated Gradient Background:** A beautiful and subtle "aurora" background.
  - **Icons & Transitions:** Smooth animations and Font Awesome icons for a polished user experience.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns:** The placement form's dropdowns are populated dynamically with available students and companies.
